# PMSM-drives-field-oriented-control-with-Machine-Learning
 A Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm is used to perform correction signals to inner-control loop (current) of the speed controller. The performance gains are supported by numerical simulations carried out in the MATLAB/Simulink environment by implementing both the suggested agent and a conventional PI controller

Reinforcement learning is employed for the successful completion of a desired task within an uncertain environment. After each sample time, the agent, which, in our model is a Twin-Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm. Agents are trained on reward basis; a reward is a measure of how successful the preceding action was with respect to the desired goal. Every reinforcement learning agent has two primary components: a policy and an algorithm.
